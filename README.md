# Optiver-Algorithmic-trading-challenge

The aim of the competition was to develop a statistical arbitrage trading strategy by analysing historical data, and subsequently implementing and testing it in Optiver's simulated trading exchange (Optibook). My team managed to win 3rd place out of 10 teams.
